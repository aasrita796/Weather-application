The Weather App is a simple web application that fetches and displays real-time weather data for a user-specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows users to enter a city name and retrieves temperature, humidity, and weather conditions along with an appropriate emoji representation. The app includes error handling for invalid inputs and has a responsive design.

It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6+), with API integration to fetch weather details. The project structure consists of index.html for the layout, styles.css for UI styling, and index.js for handling API requests and user interactions.

Future improvements include adding wind speed and pressure details, geolocation-based weather fetching, and enhanced UI animations.
